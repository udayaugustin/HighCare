Okay, now that we have the full picture with the submenus, let's create the Replit prompt to update TreatmentsDropdown.tsx accordingly:
Prompt:
Modify the existing TreatmentsDropdown.tsx component to fully replicate the "Treatments" dropdown menu from clinikk.com, including submenus, as shown in the provided screenshots.
Requirements:
1.	Main Categories: The dropdown must have the following main categories, each with a right-facing arrow:
•	Chronic Diseases
•	Skin Conditions
•	Acute Conditions
•	Pain Management
•	Infections
2.	Submenus: Implement submenus for each main category as follows:
•	Chronic Diseases:
•	Thyroid Disorders
•	Dengue Treatment
•	Hypertension
•	Diabetes
•	Skin Conditions:
•	Acne
•	Dandruff
•	Allergic
•	Fungal Infection
•	Dermatitis Treatment
•	Acute Conditions:
•	Acidity
•	Headaches
•	Sore Throat
•	Fever
•	Cold & Cough
•	Pain Management:
•	Body Ache
•	Back Pain
•	Joint Pain
•	Infections:
•	Stomach Ache
•	Diarrhea
•	Wound Infections
•	Respiratory Infections
•	Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)
3.	Functionality:
•	For now, clicking a submenu item should link to its corresponding component. Since we don't have specific components for each submenu item, link them to the most relevant existing component (e.g., link all "Chronic Diseases" submenus to Cardiology.tsx, and so on).
4.	Styling:
•	Visually match the Clinikk dropdown: white background, rounded corners, shadow, spacing, font, right-facing arrows, and hover effects.
5.	Constraints:
•	Only modify TreatmentsDropdown.tsx.
•	Use existing components (Cardiology.tsx, Dermatology.tsx, etc.) for linking.
•	Focus on structure and styling first.
Instructions:
1.	Remove any existing content in TreatmentsDropdown.tsx.
2.	Implement the structure and links as described above, creating nested <ul> and <li> elements for the submenus.
3.	Ensure the component is functional, with each link navigating to the most relevant existing .tsx file.
This prompt now includes the submenu structure and details. Remember that you'll need to implement the actual dropdown/submenu functionality using JavaScript and CSS. You may need to use nested ul elements and some CSS to control the visibility of the submenus on hover or click.
Since specific components don't exist for each of the submenu items for now the prompt is specifying to route to an existing component that is most relavent for now.
